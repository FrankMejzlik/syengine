# SYEngine
(Yet) very basic 3D game engine that allows you to conviniently script your game just using prepared API engine calls. Scripting language is C++ and scripts are just classes you can attach to any Entity (to it's ScriptHandler Component).

In scripts, you have access to all Managers and primary Components, that are attached to certain Entity, therefore you're free to code whatever behaviour you need.

# Development notice
This engine is not (yet) top priority project for us. It is more of a playgound for us in sense that it is used primarily for learning purposes and it is "just" long term project that we will push forward from time to time and maybe in future it will even become useful.

# Documentation
All documentation is present `/docs/html/index.html` in repository.

# Contribution
