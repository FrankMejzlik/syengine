SYEngine {#mainpage}
======

(Yet) very basic 3D game engine that allows you to conviniently script your game just using prepared API engine calls. Scripting language is C++ and scripts are just classes you can attach to any Entity (to it's ScriptHandler Component).

In scripts, you have access to all Managers and primary Components, that are attached to certain Entity, therefore you're free to code whatever behaviour you need.
